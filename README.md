# Business_Intelligence

This project uses Excel and VBA for project status tracking resulting in a sun ray chart that can be updated from unputs from various users. 

This project can be used to track project status from various teams in a department in the form of a spider web (also called sun ray chart) with an x axes of time (it could be quarters, months or years) 

Each team has a designated folder that contains a project file (in Excel). The structure of the project file is used for input data and is the same for each team. This file could contain many tabs. Each one of them will be included in the chart. 

Each team needs to update the status from their input files. Once all inputs are completed, the chart can be updated by pressin the "update" button. The data will be retrieved from all numbered folders in the folder structure and all the tabs in the project files.
